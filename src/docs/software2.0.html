    <td>The sonataInfoDisplay program uses a curses display window to present the status of the various system components such as the channelizers, dx's, archivers, etc.<BR>This program reads in the file sse-system-status.txt as it is being generated by the SonATA software and parses the contents into a curses screen that you can page up and down. This comes in very handy when there are potentially hundreds of channelizers and Dxs running at one time.<BR>
This application is meant to act as a replacement for the System Status text window when SonATA is running. Future versions will hopefully also replace the System Log and SSE-Seeker windows as well. The result will be a much cleaner and easier to use SonATA interface.<BR>View the source code documentation <a href="./src/sse-pkg/util/sonataInfoDisplay/html/index.html"><i>HERE</i></a>
